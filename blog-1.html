<p>Today at the HSBC Conference Center in New York City, our CEO was an invited speaker and panel faculty member on the topic of Technology Solutions Using AI that are disrupting the delivery of legal services.  Bringing an in-house counsel perspective to the discussion, Neil helped participants decipher which legal-related tasks are more amenable to the application of artificial intelligence (such as contracts) and why we still need licensed, experienced attorneys to train these AI systems.  Fellow speakers included partners from Goodwin LLP, Bryan Cave, White & Case, Mayer Brown, Ropes & Gray, Littler Mendelson, and Seyfarth Shaw, and senior legal executives from Bank of America, GE, S&P, and AXA.</p>
